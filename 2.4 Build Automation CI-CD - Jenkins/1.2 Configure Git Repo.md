# Do Something from Git Repo in Jenkins Job
The freestyle job recently created is connected to the git repository but it doesn't do anything with the repository

In the git repository, check the jenkins-jobs branch whether there is a file named *freestyle-build.sh*

In the job configuration replace *./master* branch with *./jenkins-jobs*

In the build section, the nodejs part, replace *npm --version* with *chmod +x freestyle-build.sh && ./freestyle-build.sh*

Save it and build now, you will see that executing the script, executes actually both *npm --version* and *mvn --version* commands previously set up.
